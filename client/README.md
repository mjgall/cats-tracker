# Who's in & Who's Out

Made as a tool to help employees of CATS Software log what time they arrived at work and based on that, what time they would leave. For a logged in user, this tool also displays historical arrival times plotted on a chart across the last thirty days.

Run `npm run server` in `./` directory and `npm run start` in `./client` to begin development environment.
